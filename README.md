# SkillVoyageCompass

## Overview
SkillVoyage Compass is a web-based project developed to explore and analyze job market trends, focusing on skill demand and salary predictions for 2025. I designed this tool to demonstrate my ability to integrate data processing, backend development, frontend design, database querying, and visualization techniques. This project reflects my commitment to building practical solutions with a strong foundation in programming and data analysis.

## Key Features
- Provides an interactive interface to view employment statistics, predicted salaries, and demand scores for key skills.
- Includes a search functionality for efficient data exploration.
- Offers visual representations of trends through a dedicated dashboard.
- Supports structured data management and querying for deeper insights.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw data files and analysis notebooks used for initial data processing.
- `java/`: Houses the backend logic with skill management and testing capabilities.
- `frontend/`: Includes the React-based user interface for an engaging experience (note: `node_modules` excluded, run `npm install` to regenerate).
- `sql/`: Features database schema and query files for data organization.
- `visuals/`: Stores the dashboard and chart images for trend visualization.
